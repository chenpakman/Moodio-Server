Introducing Moodio, designed to enhance your music experience like never before.
By leveraging the power of your smartwatch, we measure your heartbeat, a key indicator of your physiological state. 
Additionally, our app utilizes advanced image processing techniques to analyze your facial expressions. 
The combination of the two helps to try and detect your current emotion. 
With this valuable information, we create personalized playlists tailored to your mood, ensuring that you always have the perfect soundtrack to accompany your emotions. 
Immerse yourself in a seamless and tailored musical journey with our app, as we bring the power of emotion-driven playlists right to your fingertips.
